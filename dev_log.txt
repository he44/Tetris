I am officially going from SDL to SFML. It takes days for me trying to 
figure out how to install SDL, how to link it with my program and how to write
it into my Makefile.
And I failed...

I looked at the SFML website. Downloaded the package. They don't really have a 
MacOS set up instructions without XCode.

So I brew install the sfml package. Then I went to the web page for Linux build 
and copied the cpp code and compiled as it instructed. 

And it worked pretty well. Okay, so two major decisions:

1.) I am learning SFML and forgetting about SDL right now

2.)	I am going to start reviewing C++ and build my "Tetris" project in C++ 

	instead of C
