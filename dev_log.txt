I am officially going from SDL to SFML. It takes days for me trying to 
figure out how to install SDL, how to link it with my program and how to write
it into my Makefile.
And I failed...

I looked at the SFML website. Downloaded the package. They don't really have a 
MacOS set up instructions without XCode.

So I brew install the sfml package. Then I went to the web page for Linux build 
and copied the cpp code and compiled as it instructed. 

And it worked pretty well. Okay, so two major decisions:

1.) I am learning SFML and forgetting about SDL right now

2.)	I am going to start reviewing C++ and build my "Tetris" project in C++ 

	instead of C

I read through the first few documentation and had a basic idea on how to set up
the window and use the main/game loop.

I also got basic info on how to interpret events and global devices.

I pushed once to github. And now I am starting to read about drawing 2D stuff.

I read through the portion for sprites and all the stuff.

And now I can get the tetris logo into the window.

I read through the text and fonts version. Now I am able to put my name and date on the side.

Also created a file called resource with the logo.png and Consolas.ttf

Push once here

I did more coding on Game class and focused on drawing/storing the game board information in the game object.

Now we will be able to see a nicely game board in our window.(I added a screen shot)
