I am officially going from SDL to SFML. It takes days for me trying to 
figure out how to install SDL, how to link it with my program and how to write
it into my Makefile.
And I failed...

I looked at the SFML website. Downloaded the package. They don't really have a 
MacOS set up instructions without XCode.

So I brew install the sfml package. Then I went to the web page for Linux build 
and copied the cpp code and compiled as it instructed. 

And it worked pretty well. Okay, so two major decisions:

1.) I am learning SFML and forgetting about SDL right now

2.)	I am going to start reviewing C++ and build my "Tetris" project in C++ 

	instead of C

I read through the first few documentation and had a basic idea on how to set up
the window and use the main/game loop.

I also got basic info on how to interpret events and global devices.

I pushed once to github. And now I am starting to read about drawing 2D stuff.

I read through the portion for sprites and all the stuff.

And now I can get the tetris logo into the window.

I read through the text and fonts version. Now I am able to put my name and date on the side.

Also created a file called resource with the logo.png and Consolas.ttf

I did more coding on Game class and focused on drawing/storing the game board information in the game object.

Now we will be able to see a nicely game board in our window.(I added a screen shot)

On the airplane, wrote the basic scratch for the piece class. 

Now trying to figure out how to get periodic timing event going on so that the Piece can actually fall down.

First update since I got back home. I think I coded the part to recive a 1 second timing interrupt. 

I printed out the time elapsed as in seconds. And I think I am satisfied with timing like this.

1 second passed 1.00002
1 second passed 1.00001
1 second passed 1.00003
1 second passed 1
1 second passed 1.00001
1 second passed 1.00001
1 second passed 1.00001
1 second passed 1.00001
1 second passed 1.00001
1 second passed 1.00001
1 second passed 1.00003

Now I got the "soft drop" to work partially. I have not enforced the boundary checking and leaving the piece on game board yet. 

The good thing is, now I can make a yellow O-shape piece or a cayon I-shape piece dropping at the pace of 1/s

I am not connected to wifi right now, so I won't push. I will now try to enforce the boundary(bottom) checking and make sure locked piece will stay on the game board.

DEBUG:	one bug I noticed is that the piece won't change location in the window every second even if the printed out coordinate values actually changed. 

The solution to this bug is to move the "window.draw" section outside of the event-checking while loop and put it at the end of main loop instead.

Finished writing the function is_LockDown() and lockDown() for both Piece class and Game class.

Now the game is able to alternate between O-shape and I-shape piece and fall on each other.

Maybe I should start writing a easy function generating a random piece every time the current piece is locked down.

I think I got a roughly random function to generate the pieces. But it seems that the first one will always be red. 

And I am thinking whether there is a way to fix that.

I will push once here.

I added two functions moveLeft() and moveRight() in Piece class.

I also added event detecting KeyPressed in main loop, event section.

Now I am able to move pieces left and right. It looks good.

And continuous key press also looks good. Next step I will try to do the hard_drop function. This will make "playing" much faster.
